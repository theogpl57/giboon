giboon
=======

giboon is a simple file based CMS in PHP.

Project goal is to be able to paste some files in a directory and then configure
how you want them to be served to the user. 

Configuration is in .gibbon files and starts with a default .gibbon file which
gets replaced, if there is another .gibbon file on the current directory of the
file being served.
